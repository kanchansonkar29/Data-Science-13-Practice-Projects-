# Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions
# Assignment Topic:
# In this assignment, you will download the datasets provided, load them into a database, write and execute SQL queries to answer the problems provided, and upload a screenshot showing the correct SQL query and result for review by your peers. A Jupyter notebook is provided in the preceding lesson to help you with the process.
# 
# This assignment involves 3 datasets for the city of Chicago obtained from the Chicago Data Portal:
# 
# 1. Chicago Socioeconomic Indicators
# 
# This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a hardship index, by Chicago community area, for the years 2008 â€“ 2012.
# 
# 2. Chicago Public Schools
# 
# This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year.
# 
# 3. Chicago Crime Data
# 
# This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.
# 
# Instructions:
# 1. Review the datasets
# 
# Before you begin, you will need to become familiar with the datasets. Snapshots for the three datasets in .CSV format can be downloaded from the following links:
# 
# Chicago Socioeconomic Indicators: Click here
# 
# Chicago Public Schools: Click here
# 
# Chicago Crime Data: Click here
# 
# NOTE: Ensure you have downloaded the datasets using the links above instead of directly from the Chicago Data Portal. The versions linked here are subsets of the original datasets and have some of the column names modified to be more database friendly which will make it easier to complete this assignment. The CSV file provided above for the Chicago Crime Data is a very small subset of the full dataset available from the Chicago Data Portal. The original dataset is over 1.55GB in size and contains over 6.5 million rows. For the purposes of this assignment you will use a much smaller sample with only about 500 rows.
# 
# 2. Load the datasets into a database
# 
# Perform this step using the LOAD tool in the Db2 console. You will need to create 3 tables in the database, one for each dataset, named as follows, and then load the respective .CSV file into the table:
# 
# CENSUS_DATA
# 
# CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
# 
# CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
